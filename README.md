# THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE!
As a change to twitters elements, this does not work anymore. If a way is found, I will update this repo, but for now it will stay as just a showcase of what I could fo 8 months ago.

### This is for Educational Purposes Only!
## Twitter Automated Tweets
This is a Python library for sending automated tweets with less interaction.
This works by using Selenium and Pandas python libraries, gathers the top 5 Hashes in the world, randomly chooses them and then randomly gathers info from CSV's to make a tweet.
## How to install neccessary requirements:
Open the terminal in the folder and type **sudo ./Start.ssh**
